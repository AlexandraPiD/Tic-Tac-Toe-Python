# Tic-Tac-Toe-Python
Tic Tac Toe game programmed with Python. This was a project from the Complete Python Bootcamp course by Jose Portilla.

Setting up the game was relatively easy, the most complicated part I encountered was putting all the code together to run the game. I had to debug a couple of times until it ran smoothly and tested different ways of writing the same line of code. It took me approximately 2/3 days of a few hours of writing, testing and debugging.
Overall it was fun and allowed me to have a deeper understanding of how code comes together to paint a bigger picture.
